Week 3

Functional specification (what the project will do) is complete: Partial

Be more explicit about the user interface. 
There must be something for a user to identify themselves. 
When a change happens from somewhere else, will it just appear? 
Or will there be an indication where it came from?

There is some design documentation (key classes, mechanisms, protocols): No

There are sufficient issues to keep each team member busy for week 4: No

You aren't making effective use of the issue tracker. An issue is assigned to a SINGLE PERSON and has a 
SHORT DURATION (< 3 days). With 3 team members, there should be 6 - 9 open issues, keeping everyone
busy with tasks that can be predictably accomplished.

Each team member has closed at least two issues and has put the closed issue number(s) in their report: Ok

The project builds and does something useful. Put instructions for building and for trying out that useful feature on the wiki: No

Need build instructions! Does it do anything yet?

Week 2

There is some design documentation on the Wiki: No

You need to put together something about the basic design, in particular about
the server protocol.

Each team member has made at least one commit: Ok

Code builds on the command line, including javadoc and CheckStyle: No

I couldn't figure this out. You have two subprojects: violet and simpleserver.

How do I build violet? The package structure is wrong, so I don't think it can
be built. 

Make it so that I can run

ant

in the violet directory and get a build, javadoc, and a CheckStyle report. 

In the simpleserver directory, I am able to run activator compile, but when
I do, I get 

[error] /home/cay/Dropbox/cs151/projects/CollabViolet1/simpleserver/app/controllers/Event.java:46: cannot find symbol
[error]   symbol:   variable Name
[error]   location: class controllers.Event
[error] 		return Name;
[error] (compile:compileIncremental) javac returned nonzero exit code

Each issue doable in â‰¤ 3 days and has a single person assigned to it: Yes, but

Is "Implement REST services" doable in 3 days or fewer? 

Each team member has closed at least one issue, with # in report: No

Michael closed no issues.

Matthew, Daanish: No issue #s in report

 
Each team member submitted their individual report: Ok
